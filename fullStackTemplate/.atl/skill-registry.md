# Skill Registry

Project: fullStackTemplate
Generated: 2026-04-08
Mode: base SDD conventions + Engram persistence

## Resolution Rules

- Project-level skills override user-level skills with the same name.
- `sdd-*`, `_shared`, and `skill-registry` skills are excluded from this registry.
- Root integration work follows `AGENTS.md` first, then scoped guides under `front/` and `back/`.

## Project Conventions

| Type | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| gateway | `AGENTS.md` | Root routing for frontend, backend, and integration work |
| scope | `front/AGENTS.md` | Frontend baseline, state boundaries, required frontend skills |
| scope | `back/AGENTS.md` | Backend DDD + CQRS + Huma + TDD governance |

## Default Stack Skill Resolution

### Frontend (`front/`)

1. `template-frontend-baseline`
2. `vercel-react-best-practices`
3. `web-design-guidelines`
4. `frontend-design` only when explicitly requested
5. `tailwind-design-system` when design system or Tailwind standardization work appears

### Backend (`back/`)

Load by touched layer:

- `go-ddd-aggregate` -> domain modeling
- `go-usecase-cqrs-functions` -> use case logic
- `go-infra-http-repo-adapters` -> infra/http or repo adapters
- `go-huma-api-contracts` -> API contracts and Huma registration
- `go-shared-di-container` -> dependency wiring and container work
- `go-testing-tdd-backend` -> any `useCases` or `infra/http` change

### Integration (root)

1. Follow `AGENTS.md` contract-first order.
2. Backend contract is source of truth.
3. Then load frontend/backend scoped skills based on touched files.
