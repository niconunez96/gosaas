# Template Frontend Baseline

## Purpose

Provide a **simple, repeatable, low-complexity** frontend workflow for contributors with mixed frontend experience.

## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity first**: choose the clearest implementation.
2. **Separation of concerns**: server state != UI state != form state.
3. **Backend-centric domain logic**: frontend orchestrates UX, not heavy processing.
4. **Consistency beats cleverness**: use the same patterns everywhere.

## Standard Stack

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- TanStack Query (server state)
- Zustand (client/UI state)
- React Hook Form + Zod (forms)
- pnpm

## State Decision Matrix

Use this table before writing state code:

- API response/cache/retry/invalidation/polling -> **TanStack Query**
- Modal open/close, tabs, filters, wizard step, ephemeral selections -> **Zustand**
- Form fields, validation, submit lifecycle -> **RHF + Zod**

If uncertain, default to TanStack Query for anything coming from backend.

## Suggested Folder Convention

```txt
src/
  app/                  # app bootstrapping, providers, router setup
  routes/               # route-level pages
  features/
    auth/
      api/              # query/mutation functions
      components/
      hooks/
      schemas/          # zod schemas
      store/            # zustand store (only if needed)
      types/
    generation/
      api/
      components/
      hooks/
      schemas/
      store/
      types/
  shared/
    components/         # reusable presentational pieces
    lib/                # query client, utils, config
    styles/
```

Do not introduce more layers unless there is a clear, repeated need.

## Feature Implementation Checklist

For each new feature:

1. Define domain types and validation schema first (TypeScript + Zod).
2. Implement API layer functions in `feature/api`.
3. Add Query hooks for read/mutation flows.
4. Add Zustand store only for local UI orchestration (if needed).
5. Build UI with small components and Tailwind utilities.
6. Handle loading/error/empty/success states explicitly.

## Validation Commands

- Canonical frontend validation entrypoint: `just front-check`
- Underlying non-mutating commands:
  - `pnpm --dir front format:check`
  - `pnpm --dir front lint`
  - `pnpm --dir front test`
- CI and review workflows must stay non-mutating: never replace validation with `just front-format` or `pnpm --dir front lint:fix`.

## Async Job UX Pattern (for render/generation flows)

For backend-driven long jobs:

1. Create job via mutation.
2. Store returned `jobId`.
3. Poll job status with Query (or use SSE/WebSocket when available).
4. Render status timeline: `queued -> processing -> done/failed`.
5. On completion, invalidate related queries and display result.

Keep this logic in feature hooks/components; avoid app-wide complexity.

## Tailwind Usage Rules

1. Prefer utility classes directly in component markup.
2. Extract component only when repeated or too large.
3. Keep design tokens centralized when introduced (colors/spacing).
4. Avoid custom CSS unless utilities cannot express the intent.
5. Fonts must come from local project dependencies, never remote stylesheet imports.

## Template Design System Workflow

When implementing UI in this repository, follow this order BEFORE inventing screen-level styling:

1. Start from the canonical tokens in `src/styles.css`.
2. Reuse or extend primitives in `src/shared/components/ui`.
3. Keep the template visual language consistent:
   - Plus Jakarta Sans
   - primary-first action hierarchy
   - secondary deep teal for positive/system contrast when needed
   - tertiary container green for success surfaces
   - soft neutral surfaces
   - rounded 2xl/3xl components
   - oversized hero radii
   - shared depth tokens for cards and primary actions
4. Prefer composition over per-feature styling forks.
5. If a new primitive or token is needed, update both the implementation and the frontend guidance docs in the same change.
6. Promote repeated custom radii beyond Tailwind defaults into named theme tokens before reuse.
7. Keep responsive shell rules aligned with `front/docs/design-foundations.md`: mobile-first, desktop sidebar at `lg`, and denser data layouts only when readability is preserved.

## Current Primitive Baseline

The shared UI baseline currently includes:

- `Button` with primary / secondary / ghost / loading states
- `Input` and `Textarea`
- `Badge`
- `ActionChip`
- `Card` and `SectionShell`
- `Slider`
- `Toggle`
- `Toast`
- `Topbar`
- `SidebarNav`
- `DataTable` / `AssetRow`
- `MetricProgressCard`
- `EmptyState`

Do not re-create these patterns inside feature folders unless there is a proven product-specific need.

## Layout Consistency Rules

- Desktop authenticated/product surfaces should default to a **fixed left sidebar + top bar + content canvas** shell.
- Mobile product surfaces should default to a **top app bar + bottom nav + floating action button** shell.
- Showcase and documentation screens should organize content under the same sections used by the foundation:
  - Hero title
  - Interactions & Buttons
  - Form Architecture
  - Surfaces & Containers
  - Feedback & System Status

These rules exist to prevent design drift over time. The goal is a SYSTEM, not isolated pretty screens.

## Guardrails

- No premature abstractions.
- No custom state framework wrappers.
- No mixing backend orchestration logic into generic UI components.
- No hidden side effects in stores.

The best frontend here is the one a new teammate can understand in minutes.
