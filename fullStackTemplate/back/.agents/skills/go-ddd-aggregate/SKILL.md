# Go DDD Aggregate

Use this skill when changing domain models in `back/bounded_contexts/**/domain`.

## Objective

- Keep domain behavior inside aggregate root boundaries.
- Protect invariants through explicit methods and value objects.
- Keep external coupling behind domain interfaces only.

## Hard Constraints

- Aggregate root is the ONLY entrypoint for domain interactions.
- Internal entities are not exported for direct external mutation.
- Value objects are defined via explicit custom types and enum-like constants.
- Domain interfaces (ports) are declared in domain layer and are third-party free.
- Domain must compile without infra/framework imports.

## Forbidden Patterns

- Anemic models with setters everywhere.
- Domain services returning infra-specific types.
- External code mutating child entities directly.
- Implicit string literals instead of typed value objects.
- Interfaces defined in infra for domain dependencies.

## Required Checklist

- Identify aggregate root and invariants before coding.
- Confirm all mutations pass through aggregate root methods.
- Replace primitive obsession with typed value objects where needed.
- Define/adjust domain interfaces for external side effects.
- Verify no third-party dependency leaks into domain signatures.

## Output Standard

- Domain code remains deterministic and testable in isolation.
- Naming expresses ubiquitous language of each bounded context.
- Contracts are minimal and intention-revealing.
